# C - Algorithms
The following are some C Lab codes which I have worked on when I took up Data Structures.

To test and run the code, run it agains the test.o or sampletest.c files in your respective terminals.

#### Use the following command to run against .o file
```
gcc -Wall file_name.c test_file.o -o output_file
```
##### Note: The .o files can only be run in a linux terminal

### The Python Code can be imported for the respective uses
To import all the functions
```
import AssignmentPrograms
```
To import specific functions
```
from AssignmentPrograms import _function_name_
```
